## Project Overview
This is a React website project built with Vite for fast development and modern build tooling.

## Code Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow ES6+ JavaScript syntax
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Use modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals

## File Structure
- Components should be placed in the `src/components` directory
- Pages should be placed in the `src/pages` directory
- Utilities should be placed in the `src/utils` directory
- Styles should be co-located with components or in the `src/styles` directory

## Development Guidelines
- Use Vite's hot module replacement for fast development
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type checking (when applicable)
- Keep the bundle size small by avoiding unnecessary dependencies
